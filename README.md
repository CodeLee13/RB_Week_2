Weeks 1 and 2

For these first two weeks, you will work through the Golden Square challenges.

Goals

Learn to test-drive programs with multiple classes.
Learn to break programs up into classes.
Learn to debug your programs.
Learn to build software as a pair.
Learn to explain why test-driving, object-oriented design, debugging, and pairing are powerful practices for software engineers.
Wider course goals this module should help with (see all course goals here)

I can TDD anything
By the end of these weeks you should be able to write a meaningful test, based on the user requirements. You'll then be able to write code using TDD, to make the test pass.
I can program fluently
You'll learn how to setup and structure a new Ruby project, and turn user requirements into working code.
I can debug anything
You'll be introduced to a technique for uncovering the root-cause of bugs in your code. When your code doesn't work, you'll be able to apply a consistent process to resolve the issue.
